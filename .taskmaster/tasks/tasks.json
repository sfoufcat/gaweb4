Ensure the component maintains its multi-circle expanding animation, 'Breathe in'/'Breathe out' text, single cycle timing (5s inhale, 5s exhale), and proper dark mode support. Update the step to respect any breathing-specific configurations from Firestore while preserving the original animation design. Maintain session data flow for tracking completion.",
